description: "strategy:\n\nnew connection -> connection greenlet pair\n  request ->\
  \ new request greenlet\n\nthe connection greenlet pair is a listener and a talker.\n\
  the listener listens for requests and spawns request greenlets,\ngiving each one\
  \ a Queue to stuff results into. the talker\ngets from those Queues (reading them\
  \ to the end, in order) and\nsends out what it gets.\n\nthe above is to ensure that\
  \ responses on the same connection\ndon't overlap (one finishes before the next\
  \ begins), and that\nresponses go out in the same order in which requests were\n\
  received."
