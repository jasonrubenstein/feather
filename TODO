DOCS
- monitor api documentation, all around
- prose documentation on good patterns
  - graceful restart
  - graceful restart with rollback option

LOGGING
- rename logger for access log to "feather.log.access"
- rename logger for error log to "feather.log.error"
- have the monitor log to logger "feather.monitor"
- look into more logging for other parts of feather
- a configure_logging() function in __init__.py like greenhouse's

HOOKS
- some functions should become _-prefixed and call the unprefixed version (defined empty)
  - pre_worker_fork
  - worker_postfork
  - worker_forked
  - worker_exited (should not be called for legitimate exits like on SIGTTOU)
- evaluate what arguments should be passed into each hook

MANAGEMENT
- workers should be numbered
  - when a worker dies the replacement gets the same number as the one it replaces
- create .pid files with names generated from the worker number
